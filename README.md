# What would you fix?

This is a small sample application to give us the oppotunity to talk about code
and best practice.

The idea is to look at specific points in the code and start sharing thoughts,
much like you'd normally do in a pair programming session, about what the code
currently does, what it should do, what could be improved.

The entry points for this are:

1. relationships_controller.rb
2. user_spec.rb
3. routes.rb
